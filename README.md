# heroku-node-rproxy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nickolanack/heroku-node-rproxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nickolanack/heroku-node-rproxy)

this is going to be a web-socket proxy app with an html interface for configuration (possibly)

This is a proof of concept, I want some apps to be able to tunnel in and out of private networks using a service such as heroku as a proxy server. however only 80, and 433 are open on heroku so this is an attempt to make that work...
